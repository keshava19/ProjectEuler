# ProjectEuler
### Mathematical Problems Solutions - [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

The repository will only be dedicated to solving the 648 questions in the Project Euler site.

Every question will be dedicated it's own file and I am going to solve it using Dart programming language.

The source code can be copied and executed on [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dartlang.org).

Hope to learn a lot from solving these questions!
